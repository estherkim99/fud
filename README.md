## Inspiration
Returning to college in middle of a pandemic probably made many realize that proper meal prepping - that is within reasonable budget and provides right nutritions - is really difficult, especially if you are a college student pressured by assignments and exams.

While searching for a good meal tracking application to use to ensure we were eating healthy, we realized there actually isn't a good meal tracking app you can use in multiple platforms. There are many meal planning mobile apps with some recipe recommendation. However, there aren't many good free apps available and you also can't use the same apps on PC.

## What it does
We expanded on our idea of making a responsive web app for meal planning and decided to implement the following key features:
* Recipe sharing between friends and among communities (university-specific communities, international cuisines, etc) for inspiration
    * Browse on newsfeed
    * Search
* Saving recipes for future reads
* Nutrition breakdown of a meal plan by querying nutritional information of ingredients
* Easy drag-and-drop UI for meal planning from a recipe 'cart'
* Grocery list generator

We hope to create an application that could be a time-saving tool for many. Furthermore, we believe that this tool could help improve health of people with the nutrition checker and inspire people to try cooking with recipes they didn't know about before.

## How we built it
First, we brainstormed about the key features of the service. After choosing an appropriate set of technologies for this project, we proceeded to research and learn about the technologies we would use. While some of the members worked on prototyping of the project using Figma, the other members reviewed React & Firebase (which we used for this project) and completed project setup.
We targeted feature by feature, making sure that a feature is complete before moving onto another, so that we would be able to showcase at least part of our service and demonstrate its potential.

## Challenges we ran into
Something we realized as we planned was that we probably wouldn't have enough time to code every feature we planned for during the hackathon hours. We analyzed our skillsets and decided to implement just select key features for this project in an efficient manner and made a plan to develop on the rest of the idea after the hackathon.

## What's next for Fud (Food U Design)
* Connect API for retrieving nutrition information (Nutritionix)
* Develop import functions for various media (images, link, text, etc.)
* Develop search & recommendation algorithm for displaying recipes
* Developompanion mobile app
* Gather users and run the service!
